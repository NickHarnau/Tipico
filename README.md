## The aim of this project is/was to detect a way on how to gain some money with betting on football games. 

My assumption was that it is nearly not possible to predict the result of a football match by my own. There are just to many parameters. 
So I just looked at the different quotes and tried to detect combinations/patterns in it, that may lead to a possible winning over the long term. 
term. 
For this I just got betting data from the top leagues in europe from the website https://www.football-data.co.uk.
Then I tried a bunch of different combinations like: 
  - only bet on the favorite team (the team with the lower quote) 
  - only bet on the favorite team when it is the away/home team 
  - only bet on the outsider team when the difference in the quote is >< X 
  - and many more 
  
Then I tried to apply a classification system on this data too. 

Also I tried a second approach. I tried to follow the wisdom of the crowd. I want only bet on the teams where the majority of people bet on. 
This community predictions can be seen on Tipico. Unfortunately Tipico is about to implement a new Website. This feature is only available on the old site. 

However I had to stop this project due to COVID-19 there are no Football matches anymore.
